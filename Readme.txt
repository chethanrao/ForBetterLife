1) My coworkers are jealous of me and everyone are here to get me. I am being targeted.what must i do in this case?
Ans: what prevents you from becoming 1 percent better version of yourself everyday? Can you do what it takes
to become a better version of yourself today?
2) My manager assigned me a boring task to excel spreadsheets and i do not like to do it. How do i deal with this situation?
Ans: Take every task as a chance to improve yourself in that area. For example when you were given a task to create 
spreadsheets learn how to do it in the best possible way?
3) There is a person who wants to take revenge and hurt me. What must i do? hurt him back?
Ans: 9/10 times when you take the approach of hurting someone back you will not succeed?  Instead focus on trying to
be a better version of yourself? Your focus must be you and your goals and not get distracted from your goals?
